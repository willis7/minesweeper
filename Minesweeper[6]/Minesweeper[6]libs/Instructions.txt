The Lua functions are as follows:

-moveX
-moveY

are functions called from C++ for the movement of the character. They use a "if else" loop because Lua doesnt have case's.

-configScreen 

sets up all the necessary OpenGL perameters window width and height.

-configPlayer

calls the nested table from Lua that holds players name and starting position. Could be used for multiplayer.

-tableTraverse

is used recursively to get all objects from the nested table

-randNumbGen

is the function Lua will call for a random number

-randNumGlue

this is the function that bonds the c function and Lua

-initRandNum

this is where you get Lua to execute the script and call the c function
